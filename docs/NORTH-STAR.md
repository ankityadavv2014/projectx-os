## 0) What ProjectX IS (in one line)

**ProjectX is a global "Experience Operating System" that turns learning into real-world capability and earning — powered by kits, challenges, community, and AI.**

### Brand Core
> **In the Age of Machines, We Build Humans.**

### Core Cycle
> **Learn → Work → Earn → Multiply (eXpand)**

---

## 1) Ideal State in 12 Months (What "Fully Working" Looks Like)

ProjectX operates like a global, standardized engine that can be deployed in:
- 🏫 Schools
- 🏠 Homes (parents)
- 🏛️ Community centers
- 🔧 Maker labs
- 🤝 NGOs
- 🏢 Corporate CSR + workforce programs
- 🎓 Universities

### Users can:
- ✅ Onboard in minutes

- ✅ Earn credentials + XP + rewards
- ✅ Get matched to real opportunities (internships, gigs, work simulations)
- ✅ Build a portfolio and reputation that travels globally

### ProjectX admins can:
- ✅ Deploy cohorts at scale
- ✅ Track outcomes and learning impact
- ✅ Measure engagement + success

## 4) Global UX North Star (What Users Feel)

Every flow should feel:
- 🌍 **Entering a world** — immersive, not a tool
- 🔮 **Guided by a futuristic mentor** — AI Orb companion
- 🔨 **Building real stuff** — not consuming content
- 🎮 **Leveling up like a game** — progression & achievement
- 📁 **Collecting proof** — portfolio artifacts
- 💰 **Earning real-world value** — opportunities & rewards

---

## 5) The Standard User Journey (Ideal)

### Journey: Learner (10–15 Explorer Kit)

```
1) Onboard → choose "Explorer" path
         ↓
2) OS mode opens → "Mission 01" offered
         ↓
3) Scan QR → open kit guide
         ↓
4) Build project → upload artifact (photo/video/code)
         ↓
5) Self reflection + rubric completion
         ↓
6) Facilitator feedback
         ↓
7) Earn XP + badge
         ↓
8) Portfolio updates automatically
         ↓
9) Suggested next mission
         ↓
10) Optional: earn opportunity unlocked
```

---

## 6) North Star Metrics (Global)

Agents must implement analytics hooks for:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Activation** | % who enter OS + complete first mission |
| **Engagement** | Missions per week / time in OS |
| **Learning** | Rubric scores improvement over time |
| **Outcome** | Portfolio artifacts created per learner |
| **Retention** | 30/60/90 day retention per cohort |
| **Conversion** | Demo → purchase (schools/parents) |
| **Earn** | # of opportunities matched (future) |

---

## 7) Deployment & Governance (Global Readiness)

### Multi-tenancy
- Organizations (schools) are tenants
- Data isolation by tenant
- Role permissions per tenant

### Localization
- Language packs for content
- Region-specific kit availability
- Local compliance mapping (future)

### Security
- Least privilege roles
- Audit logs for admin actions
- Secure file uploads
- Privacy-first analytics options
- Content moderation workflows (community)

---

## 8) Tech Architecture (Ideal, but build incremental)

### Frontend
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript
- OS UI component system
- Design tokens (brand colors, typography, spacing)

### Backend (incremental phases)
| Phase | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| Phase 1 | Local JSON/content-first + minimal APIs |
| Phase 2 | Postgres + Prisma |
| Phase 3 | Multi-tenant RBAC + audit logs |
| Phase 4 | Event-driven analytics + jobs queue |

### Storage
- S3-compatible for artifacts
- CDN for assets

### Search
| Phase | Implementation |
|-------|----------------|
| Phase 1 | Local index |
| Phase 2 | OpenSearch/Meilisearch |

### AI
| Phase | Implementation |
|-------|----------------|
| Phase 1 | Scripted orb + content search |
| Phase 2 | RAG over ProjectX docs + user portfolio |
| Phase 3 | Local LLM (Ollama) optional per deployment |

## 10) Agent Guidance (How agents decide next tasks)

When unsure what to build next, agents must:

1. ✅ Check `/docs/PRD.md` for current stage acceptance criteria
2. ✅ Reference this North Star Spec for future alignment
3. ✅ Choose the smallest "platform-shaped" improvement that:
   - Increases conversion OR
   - Increases engagement OR
   - Increases reusability OR
   - Reduces risk
4. ✅ Update `/docs/BACKLOG.md` with next work items

---

## 11) Backlog Seeds (Next Logical Steps From Here)

These items should be tracked in `/docs/BACKLOG.md`:

### Platform Foundation
- [ ] Multi-role RBAC model draft (even if not implemented)
- [ ] Organization/tenant entity scaffolding (Phase 2+)
- [ ] Artifact upload pipeline (Phase 1 minimal)
- [ ] Admin content editor v1 (missions, kits, pages)

### OS Experience
- [ ] Start menu + search improvements
- [ ] Mission completion flow + XP events
- [ ] Unlock system + secret kit
- [ ] "Global map" placeholder widget

### Analytics
- [ ] Event schema for XP + missions + conversions
- [ ] Minimal analytics client (feature flagged)

### Security
- [ ] CSP baseline + headers
- [ ] Upload sanitization plan
- [ ] Audit log design draft

---

## 12) Definition of Done for "Global-Ready DNA"

Even in MVP, architecture must:
- ✅ Be content-driven
- ✅ Be role-ready
- ✅ Be tenant-ready (at least in design)
- ✅ Maintain a clean domain model
- ✅ Keep UI components reusable

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTION: Begin Implementation

Agents must immediately:

1. ✅ Convert this doc into `/docs/NORTH-STAR.md` (this content)
2. ✅ Create `/docs/BACKLOG.md` (seed items)
3. ✅ Ensure PRD references this as "Ideal State"
4. ✅ Build Stage 0 fully (OS website)
5. ✅ Prepare scaffolding for Stage 1 (portal) without blocking shipping

**BEGIN NOW.**
